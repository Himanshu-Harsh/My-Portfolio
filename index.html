            <h3>Currency Converter</h3>
            <p>
                This project is a mobile currency converter application built with React Native and Expo. It is designed to provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for converting between various world currencies on both iOS and Android devices from a single codebase.
                <br><br>
                The application's core purpose is to offer users quick, accessible, and up-to-date exchange rate information. This is a practical tool for travelers, finance professionals, and anyone needing to perform currency conversions on the go.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Technical Stack & Architecture</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Framework: </strong>
                        React Native was chosen to enable cross-platform development, allowing for a single set of code to power both the iOS and Android applications. This approach maximizes development efficiency and ensures a consistent user experience across platforms.
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        <strong>Platform: </strong>
                        The Expo framework is utilized to streamline the development and build process. By using Expo, the project benefits from simplified access to native device APIs, over-the-air (OTA) updates, and a managed workflow that abstracts away much of the complexity of native mobile development. The project is configured to use the modern, versioned @expo/cli, ensuring a fast and reliable development environment.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <strong>Key Features </strong>
                While I don't have the application's UI or logic code, a project of this nature typically includes: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Real-Time Exchange Rates: </strong>
                        Integration with a third-party financial data API to fetch the latest currency exchange rates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>User-Friendly Interface: </strong>
                        A clean, intuitive interface for selecting currencies and inputting values for conversion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Multiple Currency Support: </strong>
                        A comprehensive list of global currencies for users to choose from.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                This project serves as a strong example of modern mobile application development, demonstrating skills in creating cross-platform, API-driven, and user-focused tools.
